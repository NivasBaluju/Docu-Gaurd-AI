/**
 * DocuGuard AI — Contract Decision Intelligence Service (Phase 10)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Coordinates unified contract decision intelligence between the Node.js API
 * gateway and the Python Flask intelligence microservice.
 * 
 * Strict Enterprise Guarantees:
 * 1. Single aggregate decision intelligence endpoint.
 * 2. High-resilience fail-safe local deterministic fallback executing the identical
 *    deterministic rules and transparently flagging engine: 'local_deterministic_fallback'.
 * 3. Relational action tracking (contract_actions) and cryptographic audit (blockchain_audit)
 *    upon applying decision recommendations into the Action Center.
 * 4. Zero data fabrication: monetary figures are extracted from contract or marked NOT_AVAILABLE.
 * 5. Strict tenant isolation: user can only access their own documents.
