DocuGuard AI — Unified Contract Decision Intelligence Service (Phase 10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pure deterministic decision intelligence engine.
Implements the core decision lifecycle:
Evidence -> Deterministic Risk Signals -> Primary Dependency Chain -> Scenarios -> Decision Comparison -> Tracked Action -> Cryptographic Audit

Core Enterprise Principles:
1. Two-Tier Forward Risk: Deterministic forward-looking analysis vs empirical statistical predictions
   (returning INSUFFICIENT_HISTORICAL_DATA when historical dispute data is unavailable).
2. Mathematically Traceable Scoring: Score = Clamp(Base + Sum(Risks) - Sum(Mitigations), 0, 100).
3. No-Fabrication Monetary Impact: Explicit monetary numbers or NOT_AVAILABLE.
4. Clean, Linear Primary Dependency Chain (Clause -> Notice -> Deadline -> Consequence -> Escalation).
5. Evidence-First Conflicts with Dual Excerpts and Required Legal Review Disclaimer.
